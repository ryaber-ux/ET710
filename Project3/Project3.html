        <div class="hover-text">I am a Ghanaian American born and raised in Queens, NY. I went to catholic school for majority of my life. I played soccer in elementary and middle school but once I got bigger I grew an interest in football which I played my last 3 years of high school. I graduated highschool in 2021 and began pursing a biology degree in which I switched to a Cybersecurty major to further expand my love for technology.</div>
